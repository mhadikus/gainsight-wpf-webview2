# Known Issues

When you set a reference control via `Gainsight.Client.SetEngagementReference()`, the Gainsight PX browser window does not move with the main application window.<br/>
It also does not minimize or maximize with the main window.<br/>
_Workaround:_ Create a listener to reposition the browser window whenever the main window is moved, resized, minimized or  maximized.<br/>
